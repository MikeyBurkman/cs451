CS 451 Lesson

### Installation
Requires Node JS installed.
- I recommend installing Node 4 or greater. Use NVM.

Use the following commands:
- `npm install` to install all dependencies
- `npm run compile` to compile all TypeScript files into JS
- `npm run clean` to remove all compiled JS files
- `npm run ts app/<file>.ts` to run a TypeScript file
  - (You could also run the compiled JS file with `node app/<file>.js`)

### IDE
I recommend using VS Code. It has the best TypeScript support out of the box. 
- The supplied .vscode settings should be enought to get you going.
- If you install the code-runner extension, you'll be able to run the current file using `Ctrl+Alt+N`
